# Summative Capstone Project: Data Analysis using Python, SQL and Power BI

**Project description:** The main aim of the capstone project is to exhibit the different stages of the data lifecycle through the use of various tools and techniques.

## 1. Importing the Data

A domain of choice can be chosen on which analysis needs to be done. Areas could be sales, marketing, finance, retail, healthcare, or others. Data can be collected from various sources on the web such as google public datasets, Socrata open data, kaggle and others.

**Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/dwiknrd/reviewuniversalstudio

## 1. Data collection from various sources

A domain of choice can be chosen on which analysis needs to be done. Areas could be sales, marketing, finance, retail, healthcare, or others.

**Data Source:** Singapore Tourism Analytics Network (STAN) website [https://stan.stb.gov.sg/content/stan/en/tourism-statistics.html]

## 2. Business needs gathering and Story building in relation to business needs

This is the stage to decide on a real-world scenario with a real business or company and to decide on a convincing business need which can be used for the chosen dataset. After gathering the business needs, the next task is to build a storyline behind the data and the business needs. This is to be iterated and refined based on the business needs.

**Target Audience: Singapore Tourism Board (STB) Management**
