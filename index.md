# Capstone Project 1: Creating Interactive Dashboards and Data Storytelling with Excel

**Project description:** The main aim of the capstone project is to exhibit the different stages of the data lifecycle through the use of the tool: Microsoft Excel.

## 1. Data collection from various sources

A domain of choice can be chosen on which analysis needs to be done. Areas could be sales, marketing, finance, retail, healthcare, or others.

**Data Source:** Singapore Tourism Analytics Network (STAN) website [https://stan.stb.gov.sg/content/stan/en/tourism-statistics.html]

## 2. Business needs gathering and Story building in relation to business needs

This is the stage to decide on a real-world scenario with a real business or company and to decide on a convincing business need which can be used for the chosen dataset. After gathering the business needs, the next task is to build a storyline behind the data and the business needs. This is to be iterated and refined based on the business needs.

**Target Audience: Singapore Tourism Board (STB) Management**

## 3. Data Preparation 

**Perform data cleaning and transformation operations:** 
1. Cleaned unwanted data
2. Created and derived new columns
3. Removed anomalies and outliers in the data
4. Removed inconsistencies
5. And others.

## 4. Creating Interactive Dashboard and Visualization using Excel Dashboards
